1 - What indexes do we have available? Can you list them?
	| eventcount summarize=true index=* | dedup index | table index

Indexes

    -List available indexes

    -Count of events per index

    Top indexes by volume
	| tstats count where index=* by index


2 - How would you find all available sourcetypes?
	| metadata type=sourcetypes | table sourcetype


Hosts, Sources, and Sourcetypes

    List all hosts or sourcetypes per index

	index=* 
	| stats count by host, sourcetype, source 
	| sort -count




3 - Find failed login attempts
	index=* sourcetype=*authentication* (failure OR "failed login")
	| stats count by user, src, host

4 - Look for high failed login count per user or IP:
	index=* sourcetype=*authentication* "failed login"
	| stats count by user, src
	| where count > 10

5 - What types of logs do we receive from our indexes?
	index=firewall | stats count by sourcetype

6 - Can you monitor the log volume trend over the last 7 days?

7 - How do you check if a specific index is not receiving logs?
	from indexes list check every incoming data per index and see who is not
