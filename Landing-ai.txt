Landing (AI-Structured)

1. Index Information

(Data about what indexes exist and their event volumes)

    List available indexes

| eventcount summarize=true index=* | dedup index | table index

Count of events per index / Top indexes by volume

    | tstats count where index=* by index

    How to check if a specific index is not receiving logs (presence/absence of data)
    From indexes list check every incoming data per index and see who is not

2. Sourcetypes Information

(Data about types of data sources collected)

    Find all available sourcetypes

| metadata type=sourcetypes | table sourcetype

Log types received from specific indexes (e.g., firewall)

    index=firewall | stats count by sourcetype

3. Host, Source, and Sourcetype Distribution

(Data about which hosts, sources, and sourcetypes exist and their relative volumes)

    List all hosts or sourcetypes per index with event counts

    index=* | stats count by host, sourcetype, source | sort -count

4. Security Events (Failed Login Attempts)

(Data on authentication failures, suspicious login activity)

    Find failed login attempts (count by user, src, host)

index=* sourcetype=*authentication* (failure OR "failed login") | stats count by user, src, host

High failed login counts (users or IPs with >10 fails)

    index=* sourcetype=*authentication* "failed login" | stats count by user, src | where count > 10

5. Field and Data Structure Information

(Insight about fields available and data schema)

    See all fields available in an index (fieldsummary)

index=my_index | fieldsummary

Compare fieldsummary with raw field extraction

    index=my_index | head 100 | fieldsummary

6. Data Model Usage and Content

(Use and counts from Common Data Models)

    Common data models list (Network_Traffic, Authentication, Intrusion_Detection, Endpoint, Change, Web)

    Example queries:

| tstats count from datamodel=Authentication by Authentication.user

    | datamodel Network_Traffic All_Traffic search | stats count by nodename

7. Correlation and Notable Events (Alerts and Analytics)

(Security analytic info, notable events, and correlation searches)

    View correlation searches
    Enterprise Security > Configure > Content Management

    Stats from notable index by rule_name, urgency, status, mitre_technique

    index=notable | stats count by rule_name, urgency, status
    | stats count by mitre_technique

8. Saved Searches and Reports
